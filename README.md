1. create python 3.6 virtual environment 
2. install pywinauto, pyvda, quart, hypercorn, pywin32 in the virtual environment 
3. in order to use run.sh install rust and then `cargo installed watchexec`


this repository is kind of a mess, it's forked from `py_inspect` because i'm lazy and it's overengineered because i'm a goofball
